# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning. It employs regression techniques, particularly the XGBoost Regressor, to analyze dataset correlations and make price predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between features.
- **Train-Test Split**: Dividing data for training and evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Implementing the XGBoost Regressor.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and adjusting hyperparameters.
- **Visualization**: Comparing actual vs. predicted prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook `House Price Prediction.ipynb` step by step.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various house-related features. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the project directory before running the notebook.

## Model Performance
- The error score helps in evaluating the model accuracy.
- Adjustments can be made based on error margins (ideal range: 5-10 for optimal accuracy).

## Results
- The trained model makes predictions on test data.
- Visualization compares actual vs. predicted house prices.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the model, adding more feature engineering techniques, or enhancing visualization.
